This is a project I have done in my 1st year in university.

## Introduction:
<p align="justify">
I have made a grid-solving robot that can find its path in a grid and go to the location that it programs to do. I completed this project in the first year of my degree. The main controller that is used is the Arduino Uno board.  I used 4 dc 5v motors for this project and the motor controller is  L298N. Which can provide two 5V outputs. for grid solving and finding paths, I have used 8 IR sensors. using them I was able to  direct the robot to its destination.

### Sensors Used:

<p align="justify">
In this project, I used 8 IR sensors to help the robot navigate the grid. These sensors are crucial for detecting the lines on the grid and ensuring the robot stays on course. The IR sensors work by emitting infrared light and detecting the reflection from the surface. When the sensor detects a line, it sends a signal to the Arduino, which then adjusts the robot's path accordingly. This setup allows the robot to follow the grid lines accurately and reach its programmed destination efficiently.
