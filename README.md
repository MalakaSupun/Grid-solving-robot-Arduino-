# Grid-solving-robot-Arduino-
This is a project I have done in my 1st year in university.


I have made a grid solving robot that can find its path in a grid and go to the location that it programs to do. I have completed this project in my first-year in my degree. Main controller that used is Arduino Uno board .  I used 4 dc 5v motors for this project and the motor controller is  L298N. Which can provide tow 5V outputs. for grid solving and finding path I have used 8 ir sensors. using them I was able to  direct the robot to its destination.
